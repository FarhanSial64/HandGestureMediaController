# 🎮 Gesture-Based Media Controller

Control your media player using just your hand gestures via webcam!  
This project uses **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **PyAutoGUI** to detect hand gestures and translate them into media control commands like play/pause, volume up/down, and track navigation.


## 🧠 How It Works

- **MediaPipe** detects 21 hand landmarks in real time.
- Custom logic interprets gesture patterns based on finger states and thumb position.
- **PyAutoGUI** sends keyboard signals to control media actions.
- A cooldown mechanism prevents repeated triggering from shaky frames.

## ✋ Supported Gestures

| Gesture                 | Action              |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| ✊ Fist                 | Play / Pause        |
| 👍 Thumb Up            | Volume Up           |
| 👎 Thumb Down          | Volume Down         |
| ✋ Open Palm            | Previous Track      |
| 🖐️ Four Fingers (no thumb) | Next Track         |
| ✌️ Two Fingers (index + middle) | Skip Forward (5 sec) |
| 🤟 Three Fingers (index + middle + ring) | Rewind (5 sec)      |

> Gestures are recognized based on relative landmark positions with cooldown intervals for stability.

## 🖥️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FarhanSial64/MediaController.git
   cd MediaController
````

2. **Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

   python -m venv myenv
   myenv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

3. **Install dependencies**

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   Or manually:

   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui


4. **Run the application**

   python media_controller.py


> Make sure your webcam is working. Use the `q` key to quit the window.

## 📄 Requirements

* Windows OS (for full media key support with PyAutoGUI)
* Webcam (built-in or external)
* Python 3.7+

---

## 📌 Known Issues

* Some gestures (like 2 vs 3 fingers) may be misclassified under poor lighting.
* PyAutoGUI works best on **Windows** — media key compatibility may vary on other OSes.
* Webcam access might require permission on first run.

## 🧪 Future Improvements

* Add UI overlay with gesture feedback.
* Support dual-hand gestures.
* Train a gesture classifier using a lightweight ML model for better flexibility.
* Add settings/config panel for user-customizable shortcuts.
